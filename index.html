              <h1>Alright. Now, I wish to explain something extremely important to you.<br>
                 I will continuously update squiggly particle. The next coming update is called 'The Mushroom Update'<br>
                 Why, you ask, am I making an entire Squiggly-Particle page for mushrooms? Well...<br><br>
                 
                 It's the time of the year when the mushrooms appear!<br>
                 You can pick one up, and put it in your ear!<br>
                 You can put it on the ground and give it a beer...<br>
                 'Cause it's the time of the year when the mushrooms appear!<br><br><br>
                 
                 
                 Thank you, thank you. You will find this newfangled page on the menu.         <br><br>
                 
                 In case you can't tell, I'm a big fan of ASCII Art.
